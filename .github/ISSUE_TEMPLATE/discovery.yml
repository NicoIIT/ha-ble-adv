      If you managed to make the light blink and to create the integration please use a [Bug Report](https://github.com/NicoIIT/ha-ble-adv/issues/new?template=bug.yml) instead.

      As a remainder:
      * YOU have a problem
      * YOU are requesting the maintainer to help YOU
      * The maintainer is working for free and has no obligation to help YOU

      The maintainer may be annoyed and reluctant to help you if:
      * the answer to your issue is already in the docs that you obviously did not carefully read, so please read the docs first
      * some of the mandatory info is not provided (or not provided in the requested format) and then the issue CANNOT be investigated
      * you do not fill the mandatory info by lazyness with comments such as 'not available' or 'not needed' or 'let me know if you need more info': all requested info ARE available AND needed and MUST be provided directly.

      If the maintainer is annoyed:
      * YOUR issue will be rejected
      * YOU will have no help with YOUR problem

      If the maintainer is REALLY annoyed:
      * YOUR future issues or requests will be ignored
      * YOU will be banned.

      THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, IF YOU DO NOT REPLACE IT BY YOUR OWN SETUP THE ISSUE WILL BE REJECTED.

      I have an Irelan Fan + Light device paired to the FanLamp Pro App on an Android Phone.
      My phone is 3 meters away from my device and 2 meters away from the bluetooth adapter.
      The device is 1 meter away from the bluetooth adapter.

      When I try the recommended 'Duplicate Config' flow, 4 configurations are detected but none of them is making the light blink.

      I followed the troubleshouting guide until step 3.2a.2, including the bluetooth range check, without success.

      If your integration is NOT created successfully, then you should open a [Config Flow Discovery Issue](https://github.com/NicoIIT/ha-ble-adv/issues/new?template=discovery.yml) instead.

      > [!CAUTION]
      > As a remainder you are asking for help that the maintainer will happily provide if:
      > * you already carefully checked the doc and have not found the answer to your issue
      > * your issue contains the requested info needed by the maintainer to be able to investigate it.
      >
      > If it is not the case the issue will be **immediately closed** referring to one of the [rejection reasons](https://github.com/NicoIIT/ha-ble-adv/wiki/Why-was-my-issue-rejected%3F).

Please specify the EXACT time (with 'second' precision) at which you performed a specific action so that we can correlate with the time in the debug logs. The description of the action must also be very clear as in the example below, in particular on which device / controller you perform which action."
